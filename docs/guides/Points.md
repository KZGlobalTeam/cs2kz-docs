# Points & Rank

In CS2KZ, players earn points by completing courses and achieving faster times across different modes and filters. 
As players accumulate points, they advance through different ranks which reflect greater KZ skill. 

## Types of Points

There are two types of points that are awarded in CS2KZ:

### 1. Filter Points

These points are tied to a specific [Filter](./Maps.md#filters) applied to a course and measure a player’s performance on that particular combination of map, mode, and settings.

- **Max Points Per Filter:** The world record (WR) holder for a filter earns the maximum of 10,000 points. Players with slower times earn fewer points based on their performance 
relative to the WR and the rest of the player base that has completed the filter

- **Purpose:** Filter points indicate how skilled a player is at a specific map, mode, and filter combination.

### 2. Player Points

A player’s overall rating, or **Player Points**, is determined by a weighted sum of the points they’ve earned across **all** ranked filters.

- **Rank Contributions:** Points from harder filters and better performances have more influence on the player’s rating, ensuring rankings reflect skill rather than sheer volume of completed maps.
- **Purpose:** Player points indicate general KZ proficiency and are used to determine rank tiers.

## How Points are Calculated

The amount of points rewarded after completing a map is based on the following:

- **Course Difficulty:** More difficult courses yield higher point rewards. The difficulty of a course is tied to its filter's tier.
- **Performance:** Faster completion times and improved performance on a course will result in more points.
- **Filter Type** his refers to the overall characteristics of the filter, such as teleport settings and other conditions. The more 
challenging the filter type, the more points are awarded.

## Rank

In CS2KZ, a player’s rank is determined by the total points accumulated through their performances in ranked filters. As players complete
 courses and improve their times, they will earn points, which contribute to their overall rank.

### Rank Tiers
Players progress through ranks based on their total points, with each rank representing a skill milestone. For example:

- Noob: 0 - 999 Points
- Intermediate: 1,000 - 4,999 Points
- Pro: 5,000 - 14,999 Points
