# Styles

Styles in CS2KZ are optional modifiers that alter gameplay, offering creative and fun ways to explore maps beyond ranked competition. They donâ€™t affect leaderboards or ranks but let players experiment, practice, or take on new challenges.

## Examples of styles

- Auto Bhop
- W/S-Only
- Low Gravity
- A/D-Only
- Ice

> [!NOTE]
> Currently only Auto Bhop is implemented, however, other styles are planned to be relesaed further in development
