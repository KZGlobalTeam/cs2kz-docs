# Setting up a LAN server

There are 4 steps for setting up a CS2KZ **LAN** server:

1. [Server setup](#server-setup): Setting up the actual server itself.
2. [Metamod setup](#metamod-setup): Installing and setting up Metamod: Source.
3. [KZ plugins](#kz-plugins): Adding essential plugins to make KZ work properly.
4. [Maps](#adding-maps): Adding KZ maps to the server.

## Server setup

### 1. Preparation

1. Create a folder called `cs2kz_server` on the drive you want the server to be on.

2. Inside of `cs2kz_server` create another folder called `steamcmd`

>[!DANGER]
> Note that the folder which will be used for the server is **REQUIRED** to be on a drive with a least
> `35GB` of free space!

>[!NOTE]
> The main folder (`cs2k_server`) can be named anything you want, the name given in this guide is to make the rest of the
> instructions more simple.

### 2. Installing SteamCMD

1. Navigate to the [SteamCMD Download Page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Downloading_SteamCMD).

2. Under step `[1]` click the download link to download the zip file.

3. Extract the contents of the zip file into the `steamcmd` folder.



### 3. Installing the server

1. Locate `SteamCMD.exe` in the folder it was extracted to and run it. It will install all of the required Steam components.

2. Once it's done, type `login anonymous` in the terminal that was opened and press enter.

3. Next type in `app_update 730 validate` and press enter. This will begin the installation of the server and may take a very long time depending on your internet and drive speeds.

>[!DANGER]
> Do **NOT** close the terminal until it outputs `Success! App '730' fully installed.`!

### 4. Adding a Steam GSLT token

1. Navigate to [Steam GSLT Tokens](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) (log in with steam if you aren't already).

2. At the bottom under `Create a new game server account` set the App ID as `730` and click `Create`

3. Keep this window open as we will need the token for the next step.

### 5. Running the server

1. Navigate back to the `cs2kz_server` folder and create a new file called `start.bat`.

2. Right click `start.bat`, click `Edit`, and add this text into it:

```batch
cd ".\steamcmd\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\bin\win64\"
start cs2.exe -dedicated +map de_dust2 +sv_setsteamaccount YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```
> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that you replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your Steam GSLT token.

3. You should now be able save the file, close the text editor, and run it by double-clicking on it. It should run a terminal.
If you get a prompt to give CS2 access through your firewall, press yes.

### 6. Connecting to the server

> [!WARNING]
> You have to run your own game before running the server, otherwise it will not let you launch your game!

You can connect to the server by either:
- Opening the in-game console and typing in `connect localhost`
- Opening the in-game Community Server Browser and navigating to the `LAN` tab, and pressing connect on the server

## Metamod setup

### Installing Metamod: Source

1. Open [Metamod: Source (Dev 2.0x) Downloads](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master) and download the
latest build for your operating system (Windows/Linux).

2. You should have downloaded a `zip` (Windows) or `tar.gz` (Linux) file, extract it and move the whole `addons` folder into 
the `\csgo\` folder of the server.

> [!INFO]  
> The `\csgo\` folder can be found in:
> ```FilePath
> \cs2kz_server\steamcmd\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\
>```
> If you have followed this guide exactly as explained.

3. Open the `gameinfo.gi` file in a text editor (such as notepad), the file can be found in the same `\csgo\` folder.

4. Ignore any warnings about editing the file, and add the following to the top of the section with similar inputs and save the file:  
```txt
Game    csgo/addons/metamod
```

::: details When complete, the file should look like this:
```txt
"GameInfo"
{
// ********************************************************************************
// ********************************************************************************
// ********************************************************************************
// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - YOU PROBABLY WANT TO EDIT CSGO_CORE/GAMEINFO.GI
// ********************************************************************************

## KZ plugins

### Installing the KZ plugin

1. Open [cs2kz-metamod releases](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/cs2kz-metamod/releases) and download the latest `(pre-) release` for your operating system.

2. Extract the `zip` (Windows) or `tar.gz` (Linux), then drag the `addons` and `cfg` folders into the `\csgo\` folder (The same folder used in the [Metamod setup](#metamod-setup) step).

### Installing optional plugins

#### Jumpstat/Quake sounds support

1. Open [MultiAddonManager](https://github.com/Source2ZE/MultiAddonManager/releases) releases and download the latest release for your operating system (Windows/Linux).

2. Extract the `zip` (Windows) or `tar.gz` (Linux), then drag the `addons` and `cfg` folders into the `\csgo\` folder.

#### Database support

1. Open [SQLMM](https://github.com/zer0k-z/sql_mm/releases) releases and download the latest release for your operating system (Windows/Linux).

2. Extract the `zip` (Windows) or `tar.gz` (Linux), then drag the `addons` and `cfg` folders into the `\csgo\` folder.

#### Language support

1. Open [GetClientCvarValue](https://github.com/komashchenko/ClientCvarValue/releases) releases and download the latest release for your operating system (Windows/Linux).

2. Extract the `zip` (Windows), then drag the `addons` and `cfg` folders into the `\csgo\` folder.

## Maps

1. Open up [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=730&searchtext=kz_) and look for a map or collection of maps

2. Edit the `start.bat` (created in [Server Setup](#server-setup)) and add either `+host_workshop_map` or `+host_workshop_collection` command along with the
`ID` of the map/collection to the 2nd row on the file. If you've followed this guide exactly as instructed it should look something like this:

::: code-group  
```batch [Map]
cd ".\steamcmd\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\bin\win64"
start cs2.exe -dedicated +map de_dust2 +sv_setsteamaccount GSLT_TOKEN +host_workshop_map MAP_ID
:::

::: code-group
```batch [Collection]  
cd ".\steamcmd\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\bin\win64\"  
start cs2.exe -dedicated +map de_dust2 +sv_setsteamaccount GSLT_TOKEN +host_workshop_collection COLLECTION_ID  
:::

Replacing `MAP_ID`/`COLLECTION_ID` with the correct ID & `GSLT_TOKEN` with your token.

> [!INFO]
> Although maps can be manually added into files, FastDL does not exist for CS2, so using Steam Workshop instead is recommended.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently the Steam Workshop doesn't require you to use an api key for CS2 maps, but this could change in the future.
