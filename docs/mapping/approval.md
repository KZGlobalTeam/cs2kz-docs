# Map approval process

The map approval process structure will closely resemble GOKZ, with a few key details still to be finalized:

## 1. Submission

- **Uploading:** Mappers submit their maps via the [CS2 Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/workshop).
- **Course Requirements:** Each map must contain at least one course with a filter of tier 8 or lower, to be considered for ranking.

## 2. Review

- **Approval Team:** A group of experienced KZ community members will review the map. They are responsible for evaluating the course
difficulty, ranking potential, and adherence to community standards.
- **Objective Evaluation:** Maps will be assessed on objective metrics such as difficulty, design, and gameplay quality.
- **Subjective Evaluation:** The team will also consider whether the course is "reasonable to compete on," allowing for some flexibility and creative expression in map design.

## 3. Publication

- Once approved, the map is added to the global KZ pool. It will then be available for players to compete on in ranked or unranked settings,
 depending on the course's filter.
